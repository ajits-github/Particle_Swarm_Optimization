[Particle Swarm Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12659.pdf#:~:text=Particle%20Swarm%20Optimization%20(PSO)%20%5B,of%20them%20represents%20a%20candidate.) 
(PSO) is a population- based EC algorithm, which can be used for solving optimization problems lacking of domain knowledge. The population is constituted of a number of particles. Each of them represents a candidate.

**How does particle swarm optimization work?**

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It is a population-based algorithm, meaning that it operates on a population of potential solutions, and for each iteration of the algorithm, the solutions are updated based on the quality measure.

PSO is similar to other evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, in that it is a population-based search algorithm. However, PSO has some distinct features that make it different from other algorithms. One key feature is that each solution in the population (i.e., each particle) has a velocity that represents the direction of search. This velocity is updated at each iteration based on the quality of the particle's current position and the positions of other particles in the population.

Another key feature of PSO is that it uses a cognitive component and a social component to update the velocity of each particle. The cognitive component is based on the particle's own previous best position, and the social component is based on the population's best position. This combination of cognitive and social components makes PSO a very powerful optimization algorithm.

PSO has been used to solve a wide variety of optimization problems, including problems in machine learning, engineering design, and operations research.

**Advantages of POS:**

PSO has a number of advantages over other optimization algorithms, including its simplicity, ease of implementation, and lack of need for derivatives.
