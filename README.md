[Particle Swarm Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12659.pdf#:~:text=Particle%20Swarm%20Optimization%20(PSO)%20%5B,of%20them%20represents%20a%20candidate.) 
(PSO) is a population- based EC algorithm, which can be used for solving optimization problems lacking of domain knowledge. The population is constituted of a number of particles. Each of them represents a candidate.
