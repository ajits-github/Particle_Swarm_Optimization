[Particle Swarm Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12659.pdf#:~:text=Particle%20Swarm%20Optimization%20(PSO)%20%5B,of%20them%20represents%20a%20candidate.) 
(PSO) is a population- based EC algorithm, which can be used for solving optimization problems lacking of domain knowledge. The population is constituted of a number of particles. Each of them represents a candidate.

**How does particle swarm optimization work?**

Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It is a population-based algorithm, meaning that it operates on a population of potential solutions, and for each iteration of the algorithm, the solutions are updated based on the quality measure.

PSO is similar to other evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithms, in that it is a population-based search algorithm. However, PSO has some distinct features that make it different from other algorithms. One key feature is that each solution in the population (i.e., each particle) has a velocity that represents the direction of search. This velocity is updated at each iteration based on the quality of the particle's current position and the positions of other particles in the population.

Another key feature of PSO is that it uses a cognitive component and a social component to update the velocity of each particle. The cognitive component is based on the particle's own previous best position, and the social component is based on the population's best position. This combination of cognitive and social components makes PSO a very powerful optimization algorithm.

PSO has been used to solve a wide variety of optimization problems, including problems in machine learning, engineering design, and operations research.

**Advantages of POS:**

PSO has a number of advantages over other optimization algorithms, including its simplicity, ease of implementation, and lack of need for derivatives.

The main advantage of particle swarm optimization is that it is relatively simple to implement and can be applied to a wide variety of optimization problems. In addition, the algorithm is easy to parallelize, meaning that it can be run on multiple processors at the same time, which can speed up the optimization process.

Another advantage of particle swarm optimization is that it is a stochastic algorithm, meaning that it can find a good solution even if the initial population of solutions is not ideal. This can be helpful in cases where the optimization problem is difficult to solve and an exact solution is not known.

Finally, particle swarm optimization is flexible and can be customized to the specific optimization problem at hand. For example, the algorithm can be modified to use different types of quality measures, or to focus on a specific region of the search space.

Overall, particle swarm optimization is a powerful and versatile optimization technique that can be applied to a wide variety of problems.

PSO has been used for a variety of optimization problems, including function optimization, data fitting, and machine learning. In the context of AI, PSO has been used for training neural networks, optimizing fuzzy logic controllers, and searching for optimal solutions to problems in combinatorial optimization.

PSO is attractive for AI applications because it is a simple algorithm that can be easily implemented and is computationally efficient. Additionally, PSO does not require derivatives or other information about the optimization landscape, which can be difficult to obtain for complex problems.

One potential drawback of PSO is that it can be sensitive to the choice of parameters, such as the population size and the weighting factors used in the update equations. However, this can be mitigated by using a parameter tuning method such as evolutionary algorithms or Bayesian optimization.
